# OpenGL House Model Representation

This project demonstrates the representation of a house model using OpenGL. The model incorporates texturing, lighting, and shading techniques for a more realistic rendering. The implementation requires  **stb_image** for texture handling.

## Features

- House model representation using OpenGL
- Texture mapping using stb_image
- Lighting and shading effects for realism

## Requirements

- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW or GLAD
- stb_image (for texture loading)
- A C++ compiler with OpenGL support
- Visual Studio (for opening and running the solution file)

## Instructions for Execution

1. Ensure that all required dependencies are installed.
2. Open the Visual Studio solution (`.sln`) file.
3. Build and compile the project using Visual Studio.
4. Run the executable to observe the house model rendering.
